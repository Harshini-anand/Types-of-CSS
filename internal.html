                    Embedded Style Sheets is a style sheet where designers can embed information of the style sheet in an HTML document by making use of the element.
                    This embedding of style sheet info within style tags are done within head section of HTML.
                    Internal or Embedded CSS  can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely. 
                    The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. 
                    The syntax for embedded style sheets has no such exception. 
                    Simply you have to place the style sheet code between the head

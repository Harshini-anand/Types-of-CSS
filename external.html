                        This type of style sheet gets a separate file in which designers can state every CSS styles that seem relevant for your web site.
                        Then this has to be linked with the external style sheet from your HTML page. 
                        You have to follow some specific steps to make this conceptual style sheet implementable.
                        External CSS contains separate CSS property with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc).
                        CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag. 
                        This means that for each element, style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages. </p>

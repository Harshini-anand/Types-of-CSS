                Styles sheets that are of type inline refer to information related to the style being functional to the existing HTML element.
                Using an inline approach, rather than defining your style once, you have to write the style in every HTML element you use to design your web page.
                It can be more precisely called an inline style rather than the inline style sheet. It uses the style attribute within that HTML element.
                Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element is known as inline CSS. 
                This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute.
